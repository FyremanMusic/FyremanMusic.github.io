            A beacon of creativity - since 2015 <br> <br>

            I'm Konstantin Winkel, aka Fyreman. I started producing Electronic Music in 2015 as a hobby after 10 years of 
            playing both Piano and Church Organ. In 2021 I started building a Homestudio with high quality analog 
            equipment with the goal of helping other artists to create the music they envisioned.<br>
            <br>
            I offer Recording Sessions and Jam Sessions for artists in and around WÃ¼rzburg, as well as different
            digital services online(learn more at <a href="enServices.html">Services</a>). <br>
            <br>
            On this website I also provide a list of all the music I have created so far (see <a href="enDiscography.html">Discography</a>),
            as well as a list of all the equipment and software I use in my studio for those who are interested in the 
            technical details of my setup (see <a href="enStudio.html">Studio</a>).

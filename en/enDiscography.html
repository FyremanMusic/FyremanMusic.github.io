        <h1> Discography </h1>
        Here you will find a listing of the songs I consider to be my best work to date.
        A complete list of all the tracks I have created can still be found on my <a href="">Youtube Channel</a> 
        but most of my older songs are not good enought to be a part of my portfolio, but they are still online 
        because it shows how far I've come since I started. <br>
        They are all devided into one of three categories:
        <ul>
            <li> <a href="">Solowork</a>: Projects I have worked on completly alone. </li>
            <li> <a href="">Collaborations</a>: Projects, in which I have worked together with other artists on a original song.
                                                They have either contributed melodies, whole sections of the songs or vocals. </li>
            <li> <a href="">Remixes</a>: Projects, where I have taken a song from a different artist as a basis and have given it a personal note. </li>    
        </ul>

        Feel free to browse through those to get a feeling for the kind of music I work well with and the style
        that I use.
